b. Introduction
Weather prediction ML models use historical data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to forecast future weather accurately. They adapt in real-time and incorporate various sources, enhancing accuracy. These models aid decision-making across industries, improving preparedness for weather events.

c. Approach
1. Data Collection: Gather historical weather data.
2. Preprocessing: Clean, handle missing values, and normalize data.
3. Feature Engineering: Identify and engineer relevant features.
4. Model Selection: Choose suitable ML algorithms.
5. Training: Train the model and tune hyperparameters.
6. Evaluation: Assess performance using metrics like MSE.
7. Deployment: Deploy the model for real-time predictions, monitoring its performance.
